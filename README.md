This repository contains my Python programs created while learning Python and NumPy. It covers core Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic data structures, as well as NumPy for numerical and array-based operations. These programs are written to strengthen my programming fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and gain hands-on practice with Python and NumPy. All the code in this repository represents my learning progress.
