This repository contains all the Python programs I have written while learning Python as a fresher. It represents my complete practice of core Python concepts and my journey of understanding programming fundamentals step by step.
Through this repository, I have practiced writing programs using loops, conditional statements, functions, and core data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. I am comfortable using for and while loops, if, if–else, and if–elif–else conditions, and writing reusable code using def. I have focused on writing clean, logical, and easy-to-understand programs rather than using advanced libraries.
This repository is mainly created to strengthen my logical thinking, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews. All the programs here are written by me as part of my learning and practice, and they reflect my understanding of Python basics.
